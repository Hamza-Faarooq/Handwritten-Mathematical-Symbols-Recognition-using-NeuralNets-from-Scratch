# NumPy MNIST Handwritten Digit Recognition (From Scratch)

This project is a **pure NumPy** implementation of a feedforward neural network for handwritten digit recognition using the [MNIST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/).  
**No deep learning frameworks** (like TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras, scikit-learn, or nnfs) are used-everything is built from scratch for educational purposes.

## Features

- Loads and preprocesses MNIST data directly from Yann LeCun's website
- Implements dense (fully connected) layers, ReLU and Softmax activations, and cross-entropy loss
- Uses the Adam optimizer (with bias correction) for training
- Includes batching, shuffling, and validation evaluation
- Achieves ~90% accuracy on MNIST test set
